If you are writing a library using the [Flow type system](https://flow.org/), you might want to make your library's types available to your end users. One way to do this is to place a file with a `.js.flow` extension alongside your bundled source code. Flow knows to look inside files like this for type information.

This Rollup plugin will create one of these `.js.flow` files alongside each of your output files. The `.js.flow` file will simply `export *` from your un-bundled input file, allowing Flow to find your original type information.

## Usage

Here is an example `rollup.config.js` file using this plugin:

```js
import flowEntry from 'rollup-plugin-flow-entry'

export default {
  input: './src/index.js',
  output: { file: './lib/index.js', format: 'cjs' },
  plugins: [
    flowEntry()
    // You will also need rollup-plugin-babel or rollup-plugin-flow
    // in here to strip your type annotations...
  ]
}
```

This will produce a file called `lib/index.js.flow` alongside the normal `lib/index.js` output file. The output file will look like this:

```js
// @flow

export * from '../src/index.js'
```

## Flow Strict

If you want to enable stricter type checking, pass a `mode`
into configuration options:

```js
export default {
  input: './src/index.js',
  output: { file: './lib/index.js', format: 'cjs' },
  plugins: [
    flowEntry({
      mode: 'strict-local',
    })
  ]
}
```

## Multiple Entry Points

If you use Rollup's built-in code splitting feature, this plugin will create one Flow entry point for each entry chunk.

This plugin can also detect when [rollup-plugin-multi-entry](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-multi-entry) is being used, and will create a single combined Flow entry point when appropriate.
